ðŸŒŒ Project Title: Animated Wordscape
This HTML & CSS project creates a mesmerizing animated visual of vibrant words floating, bouncing, and spinning across a dynamic gradient background. It combines:
- HTML structure to render creative keyword elements like DREAM, SPARKLE, and MAGIC.
- CSS animations for diverse motion effectsâ€”bounce, spiral, float, and moreâ€”bringing kinetic life to each word.
- JavaScript interactivity that:
- Spawns shimmering sparkles randomly and on mouse movement âœ¨
- Adds playful transformation effects when clicking on words ðŸŽ¯
The design delivers a whimsical, energetic vibe ideal for a personal branding backdrop, an interactive splash page, or even a creative visual rÃ©sumÃ©.
